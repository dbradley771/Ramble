					<p>Because rambling happens. A lot.</p>

					<p>Welcome to the website that shouldn’t have been made but was. This was created to document the large amount of rambling <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/">Tom Scott</a> and <a href="http://mattg.co.uk/">Matt Grey</a> do in their YouTube series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUULstZRWS1lDvJBzHnkXA">The Park Bench</a>. This is definitely a work in progress, so please don’t get to upset with me if this isn’t what you were expecting. Anyways, enough rambling from me, watch Matt and Tom do that instead.</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Here we see the beginnings of this website where Matt jokingly comes up with a domain name. Funny joke.</p>

					<hr/>
					<p>Tom acknowledges the domain was purchased in this video. He also hopes the domain owner’s (Hi!) intentions are good. Don’t worry, we’re cool.</p>

					<p>That's all there is for now. Like I said: work in progress.</p>
